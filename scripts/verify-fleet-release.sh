# Poll a live cell's /health until it answers with the release that was just
# deployed AND the client bytes this release built.
#
# Called by `.github/workflows/cells-deploy.yml` after `wrangler deploy` on a
# release tag. WHY it asserts both — and why neither one subsumes the other —
# is written where a maintainer reading the pipeline will find it: the workflow
# step's comment, and the header of apps/hub/src/bundle-identity.mjs. This file
# is the mechanism, extracted only so that it can be tested against a stubbed
# responder instead of proving itself on a real release.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-fleet-release.sh <health-url> <expected-version> <expected-client-hash>
#
# Env:
#   FLEET_VERIFY_ATTEMPTS  (default 60)   poll count
#   FLEET_VERIFY_SLEEP     (default 20)   seconds between polls
#   FLEET_VERIFY_TIMEOUT   (default 20)   per-request timeout
#
# Exit 0 = the fleet is running this release. Exit 1 = it never did, and the
# last observed payload is in the message (a gate that fails without saying
# WHAT it saw sends the operator back to hand-probing production, which is the
# thing this replaces).
