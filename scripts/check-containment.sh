# The boot-assert (apps/studio/workspace-mode.ts) catches a cell that would
# START with a forbidden surface reachable. This catches the change that would
# make that possible, at review time, where it is cheap.
#
# Two checks:
#   1. The forbidden-surface vocabulary in workspace-mode.ts has not silently
#      shrunk. Deleting an entry is how this invariant would actually be lost —
#      not by someone arguing against it, but by a refactor quietly dropping a
#      line while every test stays green.
#   2. The cell image does not ship a browser automation dependency. A cell that
#      HAS Playwright is one import() away from rendering tenant content, so the
#      cheapest place to hold the line is the dependency list.
#
# Exits non-zero with an explanation. Never "fixes" anything.

# SANDBOXED entries are PRESENT AND ATTESTED — a cell serves the canvas shell
# and the vendor runtime bundles, because the member's BROWSER is what evaluates
# — but only while the out-of-process build sandbox is armed. Both lists are
# asserted here, and so is the arming, because "moved to the other list" must
# never be a way to quietly stop checking something.
#
# NOT `/_api/photo-edit`. It was on this list, and it never fit the rationale:
# the route validates and STORES a JSON sidecar (`assets/<sha8>.photo.json`) —
# the decoding it was blamed for happens in the member's own browser
# (PhotoPreviewBridge), the same division of labour that makes `/_canvas-shell`
# servable at all. Withholding it meant photo edits could not be saved in the
# cloud, reported as "photo editing doesn't work". Reclassified deliberately in
# `98a4c5ad`, which updated `workspace-mode.ts` and the hub manifest but not
# this script — so the gate was red on the branch until the v1.0.0 A7 sweep.
# Removing an entry here is a DDR-shaped decision, not a way to quiet a failure.
