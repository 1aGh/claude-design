#     name like @maude/dev-server)
#   - no `node_modules/` or transitive deps end up in the tarball
#   - reserved-slot workspaces (`site`, `apps/hub`) are excluded
#     entirely
#   - the harness command, runtime modules, target adapters, compatibility
#     metadata, template, docs, and declared runtime dependencies all ship
#   - harness tests/fixtures, backups, machine state, logs, workspace metadata,
#     and secret-shaped files never ship
#
# Run before tagging and in CI on PRs that touch `files` or any workspace.
