// The post-deploy gate, against a stubbed responder.
//
// `cells-deploy.yml` runs this loop against a live tenant cell after a release
// tag deploys, and until it existed "green" meant "an image was pushed and a
// Worker was deployed" — both true on the release that put a six-day-old hub
// layer into production. The properties below are the ones that make green
// mean "the fleet answers on the released version":
//
//   - a cell reporting the released version AND the bytes this run built passes
//   - a stale VERSION fails even when the hash is perfect (the v0.57.0 shape:
//     a self-consistent wrong image)
//   - a stale HASH fails even when the version is right (same tag, other bytes)
//   - silence is patience, not failure — the first request after a roll pays a
//     cold start the release guide measures in minutes
//   - and it eventually gives up, saying what it last saw
