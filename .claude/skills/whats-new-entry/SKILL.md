description: Append a user-facing "What's New" entry to the Maude UI feed (plugins/design/dev-server/whats-new.json) when closing out a feature. Use during /flow:done for any user-visible design / dev-server change, or when the user asks to "add a what's new entry", "announce this in the UI", or "update the changelog feed". Writes a pending entry (version null — stamped at release); can attach spotlight tour steps for a new UI affordance.

# whats-new-entry — append to the Maude UI "What's New" feed

Repo-internal skill (Maude-specific; lives in `.claude/skills/`, not shipped via the marketplace or npm). It owns the authoring + append logic that `/flow:done` delegates to via `integrations.whatsNew.skill` in `.ai/workflows.config.json`. Keeps the **generic** flow plugin free of Maude paths (DDR-D).

## What the feed is

`plugins/design/dev-server/whats-new.json` is the single source of truth (DDR-A) for the notices the Maude UI surfaces — the menubar `✦ New` badge, the first-run toast, and the panel (`GET /_api/whats-new`). It ships with the dev-server and describes **Maude's own product** updates. Schema: `plugins/design/dev-server/whats-new.schema.json`. Background: `.ai/plans/feature-in-app-whats-new-tour.md`.

## When to run

Invoked during `/flow:done` (step 4d) for a **user-visible** change to the design plugin / dev-server / Maude UI. Skip for internal refactors, infra, docs-only, or flow-plugin-only work — same judgment call as the changelog reminder. Also usable ad-hoc: "announce X in the UI".

## How to author an entry

1. **Decide if it's user-visible.** If not → tell the user, do nothing.

2. **Draft the entry** from the plan + commit. Shape (validate against the schema):
   - `id` — kebab slug, usually derived from the plan slug (e.g. `phase-23-canvas-images` → `canvas-images-link-unfurl`). Must be unique in the feed.
   - `version` — **`null`** (pending). The release flow (`scripts/bump-version.sh` → `scripts/stamp-whats-new.mjs`) stamps it with the shipped version + date. Do NOT guess a version.
   - `date` — `null` (stamped at release).
   - `kind` — `feature` | `improvement` | `usage` | `fix`.
   - `title` — short, benefit-first (≤ ~48 chars). No version numbers in the title.
   - `summary` — 1–2 sentences, plain language, what the user can now do. No internal jargon (DDR refs, file paths, task numbers).
   - `learnMore` — optional docs URL (omit if none).
   - `surface` — `design-ui` for canvas-browser features.
   - `tour` — **optional** spotlight steps, only if the feature added a visible UI affordance. Each: `{ target: "[data-tour=\"<key>\"]" | "<css>", title, body, placement? }`. (Consumed by the tour engine — Phase 3 of the plan.)

3. **Idempotency.** If an entry with the same `id` already exists, update it in place instead of appending a duplicate.

4. **Append** to the top of `entries` (newest first) and write the file back with 2-space indent + trailing newline.

5. **Validate.** `cd plugins/design/dev-server && bun test test/whats-new.test.ts` (the loader + shape tests run against the committed feed) — must stay green. The feed must also satisfy `whats-new.schema.json`.

6. **Mirror to the site** (only once Phase 2 of the plan has landed `gen:whatsnew`): `pnpm --filter @maude/site gen:whatsnew` and stage the resulting `site/lib/whats-new.json`. If the script doesn't exist yet, skip silently.

7. **Stage** `plugins/design/dev-server/whats-new.json` (and the site feed if regenerated) so it rides in the feature commit.

## Notes

- No client rebuild is needed for a feed-only change — the client fetches the JSON at runtime. (A rebuild is only needed when you touch `client/whats-new*.{jsx,js}` / `app.jsx` / CSS — and then rebuild **release**: `MAUDE_SKIP_RUNTIME_BUILD=1 bun run build.ts --release`, never a bare source boot, which self-heals to unminified dev bundles.)
- Keep entries honest and curated — this is the user's first impression of a release. One entry per shipped feature, not per commit.
