// "What does this project actually contain?" — the answer a peer cannot get.
//
// A syncing peer opens one Yjs provider per canvas it finds ON ITS OWN DISK.
// Yjs has no enumeration: a document nobody asks for is a document nobody
// learns about. So a desktop that connects to a project holding 75 canvases,
// carrying 72 of them locally, syncs 72, reports "72/72 synced", and is telling
// the truth about the wrong universe — the three it does not have are invisible
// to it, forever, by construction.
//
// That was reported as "I pressed Open in Maude and nothing happened", and it
// took a hub-side document list to even see. This route is that list.
//
// SCOPE-BOUND, LIKE THE SYNC ITSELF. The bearer is the SAME peer token the
// caller syncs with (never the admin secret — a peer must not need operator
// credentials to ask what it is syncing), and every name is filtered through
// the same `matchesScope` gate that `onAuthenticate` applies per document.
// A token that may not open a document may not learn that it exists: this
// route can never widen what its holder already sees over the wire.
//
// NAMES ONLY. No document CONTENT crosses here — sizes and names, which is what
// a peer needs to notice a gap and what an operator surface already exposes.
// Reconciling the gap is the caller's decision, deliberately not this route's:
// materialising a hub-named document as a NEW local file changes what a hub can
// put on your disk (DDR-054), and that is a decision to be taken explicitly
// rather than smuggled in behind a listing.
//
// THE LISTING ALSO CARRIES ABSENCE. `documents` alone could only ever say what
// exists, and a peer reading "exists" as authority to create a file (which
// `remote-docs.ts` does, deliberately) means a deleted canvas comes straight
// back. So the same response carries `tombstones` — names this project has
// deleted — scope-filtered exactly like `documents`, because "which canvases
// were deleted" leaks the same names "which canvases exist" does. See
// `tombstones.mjs` for why absence has to be stated rather than inferred.
//
// The field is ADDITIVE: a peer older than this change ignores it and behaves
// as it does today.

 * without it "delete a canvas, then make a new one with the same name" would be
 * eaten by its own gravestone for the whole retention window — every peer would
 * dutifully trash the new canvas. Creating a name is the one unambiguous signal
 * that the deletion no longer describes reality, and only a peer has it: the hub
 * cannot tell a fresh create from a stale peer reconnecting with an old copy,
 * which is exactly why this is stated rather than inferred from a connection.
 *
 * SAME CREDENTIAL, SAME SCOPE AS OPENING THE DOCUMENT. A peer that may open a
 * document may delete it; a peer that may not open it may not learn whether it
 * exists, so an out-of-scope name gets the same answer as an unknown one. This
 * route can never widen what its holder already reaches over the wire.
 *
 * A READ-ONLY TOKEN MAY NOT DELETE. `viewer` exists so that a credential can be
 * handed out without handing out the project; deleting is the most destructive
 * write there is, so it takes the write capability the sync lane already gates
 * on.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Deleting something already deleted is `200`, not `404`: the peer's
 * retry after a dropped response must not be an error, and "it is not there" is
