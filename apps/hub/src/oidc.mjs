// OIDC discovery + ID-token verification — Track C C1.
//
// WHY A LIBRARY, when this repo hand-rolls SigV4 rather than take the AWS SDK.
// The precedent separates on SIZE, not on failure mode, so it does not carry:
// a SigV4 bug fails LOUDLY with a 403, and a verifier bug fails by accepting a
// forged token. `s3.mjs` avoided 20 MB of `@aws-sdk`; `jose` is one package
// with ZERO transitive dependencies, pinned exactly, which is compatible with
// DDR-056's frozen-install rule (that rule forbids re-RESOLUTION at build
// time, not dependencies) and with DDR-193's untrusted-image posture.
//
// The framing that settled it: a hand-rolled verifier is not a smaller
// shipment, it is the same shipment plus a permanent unassigned obligation. No
// test of ours goes red when a new attack class against JWT is published,
// because a suite only encodes the attacks its author already knew. A pinned
// dependency is a CVE channel; our own 150 lines are not.
//
// AND NOTE WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT INHERIT. `cloud-identity.mjs` says of our
// OWN tokens: "Deliberately NOT a JWT… we control both ends. One algorithm, no
// negotiation, nothing to downgrade." Every clause there is about controlling
// both ends — the exact property this track removes by design, since the whole
// point is accepting a token minted by a party we do not control. Citing that
// file as precedent for hand-rolling here inverts it.
//
// The FLOW stays ours (PKCE, state, nonce, sub→account, the mode switch), and
// so does the network (see oidc-egress.mjs — `createRemoteJWKSet` fetches
// whatever URL you give it). Only the signature decision is delegated.
