// Byte-identity of the served client — Cloud Phase 27 E1 + D5, under DDR-209.
//
// The phase's promise is "the browser loads the byte-identical `client.bundle.js`
// the desktop loads". A promise nobody checks is a comment, so this checks it:
// the image records the sha256 of every client artifact it staged, and the cell
// refuses to boot when what is on disk is not what was recorded.
//
// WHY A HASH AND NOT A VERSION. From the last outage's own RCA: the monitor
// checked that something answered 200, and the rollback went to a TAG whose
// contents CI had since overwritten. A tag is not an identity. A hash is. The
// same reasoning is why `/health` reports the hash rather than the version — an
// operator comparing two cells wants to know whether they are running the same
// bytes, and two cells can carry the same tag and different bytes.
//
// WHAT IT CATCHES THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES. `dist/client.bundle.js` is REBUILT at
// package time (see CLAUDE.md — the committed copy is NOT what ships), and
// v0.51.1 shipped a desktop app that opened to a blank window because of it: no
// crash, no log, React mounted nothing. A build-time hash plus a boot-time
// comparison turns "the artifact silently changed under us" from an outage into
// a refusal with a filename in it.
