// The session carries a ROLE, not a bit — Cloud Phase 27.
//
// WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR. A browser session used to store `read_only`, a one-bit
// projection of a three-value role, computed once at mint. That cost two
// things, and the first one shipped:
//
//   The project's owner was VIEW ONLY, and stayed VIEW ONLY. The bit was
//   computed by a translation that has since been fixed, but a bit already on
//   a token is not re-computed by fixing the function that produced it. The
//   cookie lives twelve hours, `/data` is a volume that survives every deploy,
//   and the studio had no sign-out — so the fix could not reach the person it
//   was for. He reported the same screen after three deploys.
//
//   `owner` and `member` were the same session. Both are write-capable, so
//   both projected to `read_only = 0`, and the cell rebuilt every writer as
//   `member`. No browser session could hold `invite`, `delete` or `mirror`,
//   and nothing said so.
//
// Storing the role restores the property the matrix was built for: ONE table
// decides what a role means and everyone re-derives from it. The tests below
// pin the round-trip, the rotation rule, and — the load-bearing one — that a
// session with no stored role is REFUSED rather than guessed at.
