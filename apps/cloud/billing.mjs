// Billing, answered on the billing page — Cloud Phase 24 A10 + A11 + D2.
//
// WHAT CHANGED AND WHY. The billing page used to be one state card and a door
// into Stripe's portal. That is defensible for anything that *changes* money —
// it is the customer's billing relationship and they should hold it directly —
// but it made three ordinary questions into a two-hop journey through somebody
// else's product:
//
//   "where is my receipt for the accountant"   → the invoice list, here
//   "put the club's VAT id on the invoice"     → billing details, here
//   "what happens to my designs if I stop"     → the cancel ladder, here
//
// The third is the one that cannot live at Stripe at all: Stripe's cancel
// button knows nothing about the project, so it leaves through a door that
// cannot answer the only question that matters.
//
// PURE, AND SEPARATE FROM THE EFFECTS (DDR-196 §1). Everything here takes what
// Stripe said and returns what to show or what to send. The route module does
// the fetching. That is what makes the date arithmetic behind a deletion
// countdown a unit test rather than a thing we find out about from a customer.
