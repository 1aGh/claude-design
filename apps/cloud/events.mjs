// The product-analytics vocabulary — Cloud Phase 26 Stage 2, the pure half.
//

//
// WHY A CLOSED VOCABULARY RATHER THAN `track('whatever', {...})`.
//
// The privacy notice now says an event is "the name of something that
// happened, your account id, and a timestamp… never your email address, and
// never anything from inside your designs." A free-form event bag makes that
// sentence a promise about future authors' discipline, which is the kind of
// promise a claim-guard test cannot check. So every event is DECLARED here,
// every property is an ENUM, and the two identifiers are shape-validated:
//
//   - `accountId` must match `acct_…`, so an email address cannot be passed
//     as one. This is the single most load-bearing check in the file: an
//     email in a blob would make the published notice false, silently, from
//     one careless call site.
//   - `projectId` must be the tenant-id shape the rest of the plane already
//     validates — it is a routing identifier, not content.
//   - every other property must be one of a fixed set of strings. Not
//     "should not be free text" — CANNOT be, because a value outside the set
//     is rejected.
//
// A path is not exempt from that rule, which is why `page_view` carries a
// normalized ROUTE TEMPLATE (`/projects/:id`) rather than a URL. A raw
// pathname is a place a name, a token or a search term eventually appears.
