// The operator surface, the pure half — Cloud Phase 26 Stage 1.
//
// There has never been a cross-tenant view. The fleet was run from
// `wrangler d1 execute` and the Stripe dashboard, which works exactly until
// the moment you need to answer "is anything wrong" without already knowing
// what to look for.
//
// Almost none of the thinking here is new: `fleet.mjs` has had `fleetBoard()`
// and `costAlarms()` since Phase 9, fully tested and with ZERO callers. This
// module is mostly the translation layer between D1 rows and the shapes those
// two already speak, plus the two numbers that were only ever in somebody
// else's UI.
//
// Pure, like fleet.mjs and pricing-core.mjs (DDR-196 §1): it takes rows and
// returns view-models. worker.mjs does the fetching, operator-pages.mjs does
// the rendering. Nothing here touches D1, the network, or a Response.
//
// THE THREE HONESTY RULES this file exists to keep, because each one is a way
// an operator board becomes worse than no board at all:
//
//   1. THE PLANE'S BELIEF IS NOT AN OBSERVATION. `cell_running` is what the
//      reconciler INTENDED (reconcile.mjs:323 sets it from an action, not from
//      a probe), so it can prove a cell is down and never that it is up. A
//      board that renders intent as health is a board that stays green through
//      an outage.
//   2. MRR IS DERIVED, AND SAYS SO. schema.sql: "subscription status lives in
//      Stripe… this table is the memory between runs, not the authority." A
//      D1-derived number drifts on every missed webhook, so it is labelled and
//      linked rather than presented as revenue.
//   3. UNKNOWN IS NOT ZERO. Anywhere the plane has no answer, the answer is
//      `null` and the page renders an em-dash. A zero that means "nothing has
//      reported" reads identically to a zero that means "nothing happened".
