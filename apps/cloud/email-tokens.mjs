// Links we mail to an address to prove somebody reads it — RCA 2026-08-04.
//
// Two flows need the same primitive and must NOT share an instance of it:
//
//   'verify' — you own this address, so Google may link to your account
//   'reset'  — you own this address, so you may choose a new password
//
// The PURPOSE IS BOUND INTO THE ROW and re-checked on consumption. Without
// that, a verification link (24h, sits in an inbox) would also be a password
// reset, and the weakest of the two flows would set the strength of both.
//
// Posture, mirroring sessions and handoff codes:
//   - the value goes out once and is never stored; the row keys on its SHA-256,
//     so a database dump is not a bag of live links;
//   - single use, enforced by a conditional UPDATE whose `changes` count is the
//     verdict — two simultaneous clicks cannot both win;
//   - minting supersedes this account's earlier live links of the SAME purpose,
//     so "send me another one" means the previous one stops working.
