// The control plane's EDGE — one place that every request passes through.
//
// Written after the 2026-07-30 /flow:validate found the plane had quietly
// become the single door for the whole fleet while keeping none of the hub's
// defenses. The findings were three, but the cause was one: there was no edge.
// Six separate `html()` helpers each carried their own header object, so the
// one surface that renders a PASSWORD FIELD (auth-routes.mjs) was also the one
// that had never been given a CSP — not by decision, by drift. And the login
// path spent 6×100k PBKDF2 iterations per unauthenticated request with no
// budget at all, while the hub's own login carries the comment "rate-limit
// BEFORE touching scrypt".
//
// So this module is deliberately NOT three fixes. It is the missing layer:
//
//   sameSiteGate   — a browser telling us the request came from another site
//   costGate       — a budget on the paths that cost real work to answer
//   harden         — the response headers every answer gets unless it opts out
//
// The rule that keeps it working: routes may TIGHTEN what the edge stamps
// (device-auth's `default-src 'none'` is stricter and survives untouched), but
// they can no longer FORGET it, and a new route inherits the floor for free.

/** Paths that pay for themselves — every other path is exempt from the budget. */

  // the plane, and the one an attacker most wants to repeat.
