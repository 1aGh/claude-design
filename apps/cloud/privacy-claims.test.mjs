//
// Same mechanism as `trust-claims.test.mjs`, for the same reason and against a
// sharper failure. Until this phase the notice said, verbatim:
//
//     "We hold no analytics, no tracking pixels, and no advertising
//      identifiers."
//
// Shipping a single `writeDataPoint` would have made that sentence false on
// the day it deployed, and GDPR Art. 13 wants the notice BEFORE the
// processing, not after. Nobody would have noticed, because a privacy page is
// exactly the document nobody re-reads.
//
// So the revision and the first emitted event shipped in the same change, and
// this file is what keeps them from drifting apart afterwards. It checks the
// page against the CODE, in both directions:
//
//   - what the page still PROMISES must still be true of the code;
//   - what the code now DOES must still be described on the page.
//
// The second direction is the one that matters. A claim-guard that only
// verifies the promises would stay green through a new event type carrying an
// email address.
