// Who is on a project, and what happens when they are removed.
// Cloud Phase 22 Task 5 (DDR-204). Pure decision module.
//
// REMOVAL IS THE HARD HALF. Adding somebody is a row. Removing somebody has to
// answer "and what about the access they already have", and that question used
// to have no good answer: membership was implied by who held a password on a
// particular cell, so removing a person meant reaching into their cell, and
// a session they had already opened kept working regardless.
//
// Now membership is a control-plane fact, so removal can be complete. But
// completeness has a shape worth stating: a project access token is verified
// OFFLINE by the cell (DDR-204 — a control-plane outage must not lock anyone
// out of their own work). Offline verification means a token cannot be
// recalled. So removal is only as fast as the token is short, and this module
// is where that trade is written down rather than discovered.
