// PURE: takes the schema TEXT, never reads a disk. That is not tidiness — a
// `readFileSync` here made the Worker unpublishable (`No such module
// "node:fs"`), and the failure was invisible locally because the deploy
// output was being grepped for a success line. CI caught it; the decision
// layer taking data instead of fetching it is what makes that fixable in one
// place (DDR-196 §1).
//
// Who supplies the text:
//   - the Worker: `import schemaSql from './schema.sql'` via wrangler's Text
//     rule, so `schema.sql` stays the single source of truth;
//   - Node tests and local tools: `readSchemaSql()` below, which is the only
//     thing in this file that touches a filesystem and is never imported by
//     the Worker.
