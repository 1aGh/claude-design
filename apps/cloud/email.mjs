// Sending email — Cloud Phase 22, the invite's missing half.
//
// An invitation that only writes a row is a message nobody receives. This
// module is the ONE place the control plane talks to the email provider
// (Resend), so "which address do we send from" and "what happens when sending
// fails" are each decided exactly once.
//
// Posture:
//   - Content is built by pure functions (testable, vocabulary-lintable).
//   - `sendEmail` NEVER throws. An invitation whose email bounced is still an
//     invitation — the caller decides what to tell the person on screen, and a
//     provider outage must not turn into a 500 on a form submit.
//   - The API key is read at call time from env, never captured or logged.
