// Relative-import rewriting for a canvas that CHANGES FOLDER (issue #114).
//
// THE BUG THIS MODULE EXISTS TO FIX. `moveCanvas` / `moveFolder` relocated a
// canvas with a bare `rename()` — bytes moved, specifiers didn't. A canvas
// dragged from `ui/` into `ui/print/` kept
//
//     import { … } from "../system/alligators/preview/_kit";
//     import "../system/alligators/preview/_layout.css";
//
// which is only correct one level up, so the canvas 500s on the next build with
// `Could not resolve`. Nothing anywhere in the tree rewrote imports; the
// capability simply did not exist. It reads like a sync bug from the outside
// (the broken file shows up on every peer), which is how it got reported
// alongside one — but it is entirely local to the move.
//
// Deliberately regex-over-known-vocabulary rather than a parser: it matches the
// house style of the other static readers (`_canvas-rects-static.mjs`), it
// cannot fail closed on a canvas whose syntax a parser would reject, and the
// vocabulary is small and fixed. Only `./`- and `../`-prefixed specifiers are
// touched — a bare or aliased specifier (`react`, `@maude/canvas-lib`) is
// resolved by the bundler, not by depth, and rewriting one would break it.
