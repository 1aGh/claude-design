// _pw-launch.mjs — shared Chromium launcher for the export / screenshot shims.
//
// Every renderer shim (_png/_pdf/_svg/_html/_pptx/_enumerate-artboards/
// _screenshot-playwright.mjs) opens a Chromium instance with `chromium.launch()`.
// Playwright the npm package can be present while its browser BINARY is not — the
// package install and `npx playwright install chromium` are separate steps, and
// the dependency check `npx playwright --version` only proves the former. When
// the binary is missing, `launch()` rejects with a multi-line stack trace that
// `exporters/*.ts` rethrows and `/_api/export` surfaces verbatim as an opaque
// 500 ("nefunguji exporty"). This helper funnels that one failure mode through a
// single place: it prints one actionable line and exits with a distinct code, so
// the export endpoint's 500 body becomes the remediation instead of a stack. Any
// OTHER launch error is rethrown untouched — real diagnostics are preserved.
//
// See `.ai/logs/rca/issue-nefunguji-exporty.md`.

/**
 * Inject a JS bundle into a page whose CSP refuses inline scripts.
 *
 * `page.addScriptTag({ content | path })` writes an INLINE `<script>`, which the
 * canvas origin's shell CSP (`script-src 'self' 'sha256-…'`) refuses outright —
 * and the render worker (DDR-230) always loads the canvas from that origin, so
 * every shim that injected this way failed there (worker-lane SVG, then mp4 /
 * webm / gif: "Executing inline script violates the following Content Security
 * Policy directive"). See DDR-232 §3.
 *
 * This serves the bundle at a SAME-ORIGIN virtual URL through Playwright
 * request interception and adds it as `<script src>`. CSP is enforced on the
 * script's URL origin, which is `'self'`, so it passes — and because the tag is
 * a real module script in the document, bare specifiers still resolve through
 * the shell's importmap (the render lib NEEDS that: it externalizes `remotion`
 * to share the page's instance, DDR-148). Measured, not assumed: a route-
 * fulfilled module under the exact CSP shape resolves an importmap specifier;
 * `addInitScript` cannot (it runs before the importmap exists).
 *
 * No CSP is relaxed. On the main origin (desktop), where the CSP is env-gated
 * off, this is simply equivalent to the inline injection it replaces.
 *
