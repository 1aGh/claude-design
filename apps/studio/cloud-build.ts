// The cloud build — Cloud Phase 27 D1: ELIMINATE, do not un-route.
//
// A cell already refuses every one of these surfaces three times over: the
// route table is pruned at boot (`workspace-mode.ts`), the hub's manifest denies
// them, and a running cell 404s all of them. That is operational containment,
// and it is not the same claim as DDR-123's "claude never runs on our
// infrastructure" — which is a statement about what is IN the image, not about
// what answers. Code that is present is code that a future route, a future
// import, or a future mistake can reach.
//
// WHAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE. `--define` plus dead-code elimination does not work
// here: Bun inlines a dynamically-imported module and keeps the branch, so the
// bytes stay (verified before writing any of this — the sentinel survived a
// minified `--define`d build). What DOES work is substitution at build time:
// `Bun.build({ compile })` accepts plugins, and a plugin that replaces a module
// with an inert one removes the original from the binary entirely. Verified the
// same way: the sentinel string is absent from the compiled artifact.
//
// WHAT IS NOT ELIMINATED, AND WHY. System git stays — Phase 27 D2 makes it the
// engine a cell RUNS on, because two git engines over one index is not a race a
// careful caller can avoid. Its presence is deliberate and is not part of the
// secret-bearing surface: it carries no credential and spawns nothing the tenant
// can name.
//
// The stubs are GENERATED from each module's own export list rather than
// hand-written. A hand-written stub is a second copy of an interface, and the
// day it falls behind is the day the cloud build fails to boot for a reason
// nobody can see. Reading the real file's exports means a module that grows a
// function still stubs cleanly.
