// feature-acp-write-path-scope Addendum, Task 9 — the branch-switch warning.
//
// `RepoBranchSwitcher.jsx` has THREE `window.location.reload()` call sites
// (`switchDraft`, `createDraft`, and the local-merge fold in `foldDraft`). All
// three move the worktree, so all three need the gate; covering one and missing
// two is the easy mistake, which is why the source-shape assertion below exists
// alongside the copy tests.
//
// Why the wording matters enough to test: this is a safety prompt, and Task 8
// changed what is TRUE about it. Before, the reload killed the running turn, so
// "this will stop it" was accurate. Now the bridge outlives its socket, so the
// turn keeps going — into a worktree that has moved under it. "Will stop it"
// would now be false in the reassuring direction.

// SECURITY (security-auditor A6) — cross-PROJECT loopback adjacency.

// Before the sidecar pool (Addendum Task 10) at most one dev-server ran at a
// time, so "another Maude instance on another loopback port" was not a state the
// product produced. The pool makes concurrency DESIGNED-IN: projects A and B now
// routinely run side by side on different ports, and A's canvas iframe is
// untrusted content (DDR-054). So the question "can A's canvas reach B's
// privileged main origin?" went from hypothetical to worth an explicit test.
//
// The defence is `sameOriginWrite`'s host+port compare — different instance,
// different port, different `host`, rejected. Asserting it here so the property
// is pinned to the pool's introduction rather than left as an inference.
