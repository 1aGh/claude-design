// Sync supervisor — one owner of the live sync runtime, so linking a project
// can START SYNCING instead of asking a person to restart the app.
//
// Why this exists: `createSyncRuntime` captures `cfg.linkedHub` once, and
// `reloadConfig` deliberately refuses to hot-swap it (a config.json is
// committed and travels with the repo — a poisoned one must never re-point the
// sync socket, DDR-149). That rule is about the FILE WATCHER, and it was being
// paid for by the person: after pressing Connect in the cloud panel the whole
// product did nothing visible and the UI said "restart the studio server to
// start syncing" — a sentence with no button behind it, and no meaning at all
// inside the desktop app, where there is no server the person can see.
//
// The supervisor separates the two paths that were conflated:
//
//   • a linkedHub arriving from DISK        → still boot-pinned, still refused;
//   • a linkedHub the person JUST AUTHORIZED in trusted app chrome, whose hub
//     credential this process itself stored one line earlier → adopted in
//     memory and applied by a real stop() + start() cycle.
//
// The second path never reads the value back off disk: `restart()` takes the
// LinkedHub object the attach lane just wrote, so nothing that happens to
// `.design/config.json` in between can steer the socket.
