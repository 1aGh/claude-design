// The desktop file ledger — Sync v2 Increment 3 (DDR-226 §3).
//
// Three jobs, one file:
//
//   1. **The ancestor store.** Per path, the hash this machine last reconciled
//      through. It is what turns "the two sides differ" from a coin flip into
//      a fact (see `decide-file.ts`).
//   2. **The stat cache.** `(size, mtimeMs) → hash`, so a boot reconcile hashes
//      only files that actually moved. On a converged project the steady-state
//      cost is a stat per file and no reads at all.
//   3. **The doručenka.** Per-path delivery state, so "where is file X" is a
//      lookup instead of archaeology across four logs (DDR-214's deferred
//      ledger, now due).
//
// It lives at `<designRoot>/_state/file-ledger/<hubId>.json`. `_state/` is
// already IGNORED in all four DDR-115 lists, so this adds no taxonomy churn and
// no `_*` path anybody has to remember to add anywhere.
//
// **Deleting it is always safe.** It holds no content — only hashes of content
// that exists elsewhere. Losing it forces a re-anchor: every path looks
// first-seen, differences become conflict-copies rather than overwrites, and
// the project converges noisily instead of losing anything.
//
// ── The write-ordering invariant, and why it lives HERE ─────────────────────
//
// The one rule that makes crashes survivable:
//
//     BYTES LAND FIRST. THE ANCESTOR MOVES SECOND.
//
// If we crash between the two, the ancestor LAGS: it names bytes older than
// what is on disk. The next pass then sees local ≠ ancestor and treats it as a
// local change — a conflict-copy at worst, noise. If the order were reversed
// the ancestor would LEAD: it would name bytes that never landed, and the next
// pass would read a real local file as "already reconciled" and let the hub
// overwrite it. That is the eraser class, and it is the reason the ordering is
// not left to callers to remember: `adoptAfter` takes the byte-landing as a
// callback and records the ancestor only on its success. There is no exported
// way to move an ancestor without landing something first.
