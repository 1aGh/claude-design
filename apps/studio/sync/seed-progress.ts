// How far the file plane has got — derived from the LEDGER, which is the one
// thing that stayed correct.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. During two real runs against an 8.8 GB project the
// status payload reported `files: {synced: 0, pushed: 0, pulled: 0}` for twenty
// minutes while 2 961 ledger rows changed underneath it. The counters were not
// broken so much as mis-sourced: `sync/index.ts` derived them from PER-PASS
// results, and a pass where nothing converges is legitimately all zeros. The
// ledger, meanwhile, was current to within a second the whole time and nothing
// read it.
//
// And even correct counters could not answer the question a seed actually
// raises. `synced`, `pushed`, `pulled` are numerators with no denominator, so
// no surface could say "1 412 of 2 961" — only "1 412", which is
// indistinguishable from "1 412 and finished".
//
// A LEAF MODULE, like `limits.ts`, and for the same reason: `status.ts` will
// import this, and this must never import back. It takes ledger rows and
// returns a shape. No disk, no clock beyond what it is handed, no I/O.
