// Poke → `fs:any` → the existing HMR heal — Sync v2 Increment 2 (DDR-226 §6).
//
// This is the last hop of the fix, and it deliberately adds no new UI path: the
// studio already knows how to repoint a broken `<img>` when a media file lands
// (`canvas-hmr {mode:'asset'}`, DDR-224) and how to hot-swap a stylesheet. All
// that was ever missing in a container was the EVENT — `fs.watch` does not fire
// for the hub process's atomic tmp+rename writes, so the child never learned.
//
// So: the hub pokes, this asks the journal WHICH paths moved, and emits the
// `fs:any` the watcher owed us. Everything downstream is unchanged.
//
// WHY IT ASKS INSTEAD OF BEING TOLD. The poke carries a head and nothing else,
// on purpose (DDR-054 — a frame carrying a path would be a path the hub chose).
// The journal read is authenticated and scope-filtered, its rows are re-shaped
// on arrival (`journal-client.ts`), and this only ever emits a bus event for a
// path — it materializes nothing. A hostile hub's best case here is making the
// child re-read files it already has.
//
// A LOST POKE COSTS LATENCY, NEVER CORRECTNESS. The cursor only ever moves
// forward on a page we actually parsed, and the 20 s reconciler poll is still
// underneath. If the channel is down for an hour, the heal is late by an hour;
// nothing diverges.
