// Where a synced canvas belongs on disk — the one answer both receivers use.
//
// A document name carries a FLATTENED slug (`ui/2026/social/summer-camp.tsx` →
// `ui-2026-social-summer-camp`). `/`→`-` is not reversible, so neither receiver
// could reconstruct the folder and both wrote the body flat at the design root.
// A file there is inside no `canvasGroups` entry, which means the file tree does
// not list it and `scanCanvases` does not sync it onward: the canvas arrives and
// is invisible.
//
// So the path travels WITH the document, in `syncMeta.path` — an existing,
// already-synced, never-materialized lane. This module is the receiver's half:
// it decides whether to believe it.
//
// WHY THE RECEIVER CHECKS RATHER THAN TRUSTS. DDR-054 treats hub-pushed content
// as untrusted, and a path is a strictly more dangerous input than a slug — a
// slug can only name a file, a path chooses a directory. The load-bearing rule
// is #7 below: the path must slug BACK to the document carrying it. That makes
// a hostile path self-defeating, because a path pointing somewhere else no
// longer addresses this document. The value is not believed because the sender
// is trusted; it is believed because it was checked against a value the
// receiver derived independently.
//
// A rejected path is never fatal. It degrades to `fallbackCanvasPath`, which is
// today's behaviour made VISIBLE — flat, but inside a canvas group.
//
// ONE COPY, TWO RUNTIMES (the `apps/hub/Dockerfile` rule). The hub imports this
// file rather than re-typing it in `.mjs`, exactly as it does for
// `sync/autocommit.ts` and `cloud/mirror.mjs`: re-typing a guarantee is
// re-typing it without its tests. Hence dependency-free — no `node:path`, no
// `node:fs`, nothing a plain-Node hub or a bun-compiled sidecar has to resolve.
// Callers that need real disk resolution pass `join`/`resolve`/`sep` in, the
// way `pullTargets` already does.

 * Where a canvas goes when no path arrived, or the one that did was refused.
 *
 * Flat — a slug cannot be un-flattened without guessing — but placed INSIDE a
 * canvas group wherever that is possible, because the design root is not inside
 * one: the file tree and `scanCanvases` enumerate `canvasGroups`, so the old
 * design-root fallback produced a file nobody could see and that never synced
 * onward. A flat file in `ui/` is untidy; a flat file at the root is lost.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES THIS. Moving a canvas is already a new document
 * (the slug derives from the path), so the fallback may not put the body
 * anywhere that re-slugs. Writing `ui-legacy` to `ui/ui-legacy.tsx` would slug
 * to `ui-ui-legacy` on the receiver's next scan: a SECOND document, syncing the
 * same bytes under a different name, with the original left orphaned on the hub
 * — a duplicate is strictly worse than an untidy file.
 *
 * So the group is chosen by the slug's own prefix, which is where the slug came
 * from in the first place: `ui-legacy` → `ui/legacy.tsx`, which slugs back to
 * `ui-legacy`. Visible AND the same document. A slug matching no declared group
 * (a canvas that was already outside every group at its author) keeps today's
 * design-root behaviour — identity preserved, still invisible, and no worse
 * than before. That case cannot be fixed without either a path or a rename, and
 * a path is exactly what `syncMeta.path` supplies.
