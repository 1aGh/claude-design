// THE LEGACY PUSH CLIENT — journal-less hubs only (Sync v2 Increment 5).
//
// On any hub that carries a journal, the file plane (`file-plane.ts`) is the
// one lane for every project file, both directions, and this module is never
// invoked (the capability probe in `sync/index.ts` decides the lane once per
// boot). What remains here is the compat client for self-hosted hubs that
// have not upgraded: the bounded, sequential, in-process push pass the pre-v2
// desktop ran. Retained AT LEAST TWO RELEASES after the burn-down (Open
// decision 4 of the journal arc) — delete it only against a compat matrix
// that says the window has closed.
//
// Original charter (still accurate for the hubs this serves) — DDR-217, the
// 2026-08-11 addendum, and the feature-sync-file-plane widening (binding
// decision maude/sync-two-plane-manifest-architecture):
//
// The sync lanes are text-only (`html`/`css`/`meta`/`syncMeta`), so a
// desktop-linked project's other files never reached the cell — first seen as
// grey boxes (binary assets), then as a whole design system that never
// arrived (the 103-file RCA). The desktop is the one peer that HAS the bytes
// and already holds an authenticated channel to the hub, so it pushes them.
//
// MEMBERSHIP IS THE CLASSIFIER'S (`file-membership.ts`) — the same positive
// enumeration the downward plane and the hub's own admission use: inert
// media, companion text (`brand.css`, `README.md`), and code modules
// (`_brand-css.ts`), with `canvas-owned` (the CRDT lanes') and `never`
// (config, runtime state, everything unclassified) excluded. The old
// assets-dir walk + binary-extension pair lived here; it is subsumed, not
// joined, by the classifier.
//
// TWO ROUTES REMAIN, split by PATH (`routeFor`):
//
//   1. TOP-LEVEL content-addressed uploads (`<designRoot>/assets/<sha8>.<ext>`)
//      — referenced by the `/assets/<key>` shortcut, served on the cloud from
//      the BUCKET proxy. Push → `PUT /assets/<key>` (bucket + checkout mirror).
//   2. EVERYTHING ELSE (DS assets, stylesheets, docs, shared modules) —
//      referenced by designRoot path, served from the CHECKOUT. Push →
//      `PUT /_asset-file/<designRoot-rel>` (classifier-gated on the hub too).
//
// Both are probe-first (skip what the cloud already holds) and streamed. The
// HUB's validation is the authoritative gate at each trust boundary; the
// filters here are the courtesy layer that keeps junk off the wire.
