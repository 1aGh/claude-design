// Desktop ↔ cloud live pairing, variant C2 — the ONE exception to "a cell does
// not sync" (DDR-209 / Cloud Phase 27 D2).
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS OPENS A DOOR FOR. A cell holds two disjoint Y.Doc worlds: the
// hub's Hocuspocus documents (which the DESKTOP syncs to, SQLite-backed) and the
// studio child's own collab rooms (which BROWSERS join, in-memory). Nothing
// crosses. Two people on the same project — one in the app, one in a tab — never
// see each other's cursors and never see each other's edits, which is the
// headline of the cloud product.
//
// WHY THE DOOR IS SHAPED LIKE THIS. DDR-209 forbids the studio child from
// syncing out, for two named reasons, and BOTH are preserved literally here
// rather than argued away:
//
//   1. "dial OUT from the cell to a third-party hub carrying the project's
//      canvases" — so the URL must be LOOPBACK. Not "usually loopback", not
//      "loopback in production": the resolver refuses anything else, and the
//      tenant's own `.design/config.json linkedHub.url` is never read for it.
//      A cell talking to 127.0.0.1 is a process talking to itself.
//   2. "start a SECOND autocommit over the working tree the hub is already
//      committing" — so autocommit must be explicitly DISABLED, by a flag the
//      caller has to set on purpose. Default-absent means refuse.
//
// A third condition is ours, not DDR-209's, and it narrows further: shared-doc
// must be ON. Without it the loopback provider would open a SECOND Y.Doc per
// canvas beside the room's — the two-doc world this pairing exists to collapse —
// and its agent would become a second doc→file writer for no benefit at all.
//
// WHAT IS TAKEN FROM THE TENANT'S CONFIG, AND WHY IT MUST BE. The URL and the
// credential come from the environment (the hub minted them for its own child).
// The WORKSPACE ID does not: it comes from `linkedHub.workspaceId`, the tenant's
// own file, because it decides the DOCUMENT NAME on the wire (DDR-192 §5). The
// desktop resolves it from that same field. If the cell derived a different one,
// the browser and the desktop would sync to two differently-named documents and
// converge on nothing — this whole feature, silently doing exactly what it did
// before. Honouring the tenant's `url` is a dial-out; honouring their
// `workspaceId` is the only way the two ends can meet.
