// "Sign in to workspace" — Cloud Phase 3 Task 3.
//
// The Phase-2 hub can authenticate a PERSON (`POST /auth/login` → a scoped,
// expiring peer token). This is the client half: the flow that turns "my
// teammate sent me an address" into a working, synced project without the
// person ever seeing the word "token".
//
// The vocabulary rule is not cosmetic (DDR-193 §5). The persona this product
// lives or dies by is the invited teammate who has never used git. Every string
// on this path says "sign in", "workspace", "project" — never token, never
// repository, never OAuth. A flow that says "paste your bearer token" has
// already told that person the product is not for them.
//
// TOKEN CUSTODY (unchanged from DDR-054 / the phase-29 A2 finding, and the
// reason this file reuses hub-link.ts rather than writing its own storage):
//
//   • the health probe is TOKENLESS — a lookalike address must never receive a
//     credential;
//   • the password goes ONLY to the address the user typed, once, and is never
//     stored anywhere, in memory or on disk, after the request;
//   • what IS stored is the minted peer token, in `~/.config/maude/hubs.json`
//     at mode 0600, keyed by normalized URL — the same store `maude design
//     link` writes, so a project opened later just works.
//
// The token now EXPIRES (Phase 2), which changes one thing for the client: a
// sync failure can mean "your session ran out" rather than "something broke",
// and the honest response is to ask the person to sign in again rather than to
// silently retry forever.
