// Ghostscript — the `text: 'outline'` post-pass for PDF export (issue #116).
//
// Chromium emits Type 3 fonts for colour fonts and synthetic italics and has
// no switch to stop it; `page.pdf()` has no outline mode; and pdf-lib cannot
// convert a glyph to a path. Ghostscript's `-dNoOutputFonts` does exactly one
// thing — replace every glyph with its vector outline — and it is the only
// off-the-shelf tool that does. So this module shells out to it.
//
// WHY AN EXTERNAL BINARY, AND WHY IT IS NOT BUNDLED
// ------------------------------------------------
// Ghostscript is AGPL-3.0 and Maude is MIT. Exec'ing an unmodified `gs` the
// user (or the image) installed is clean and ordinary; shipping it INSIDE the
// signed `.app` would drag AGPL distribution obligations and third-party
// notarization into the packaged product, on every platform, for one opt-in
// export mode. So: `apps/render/Dockerfile` installs it, which makes the cloud
// lane work with no user setup; the desktop app and the npm CLI resolve it off
// PATH and fail LOUD when it is absent. Writing our own outliner was weighed
// and rejected — see the DDR; the short version is that a DOM-side pass cannot
// handle COLRv1 layering (the exact font that motivated the issue) and a
// content-stream pass means emulating the whole PDF text-state machine.
//
// FAILURE POSTURE — DELIBERATELY THE OPPOSITE OF pptx.ts
// -----------------------------------------------------
// `pptx.ts` resolves an optional `svg2pptx` the same way and, when it is
// missing, quietly falls back to a PNG deck. That is right there: the user
// asked for slides and gets slides. It would be WRONG here. A user who asked
// for outlines and silently receives a PDF with live Type 3 fonts has been
// handed the precise artifact this feature exists to prevent, and will find
// out from their printer. Missing `gs` is an error, never a fallback.

/**
 * The flag set, measured rather than assumed (plan Task 9).
 *
 * `-dNoOutputFonts` is the feature; everything else exists to stop Ghostscript
 * from helpfully ruining the raster content on the way through. Measured on a
 * three-page photo PDF (1600x1200 JPEG per page, `pdfimages -list` before and
 * after):
 *
 *   | flags                                    | size    | image enc | px / ppi |
 *   | pass-through ON  + forced Flate (this)   | 144 483 | jpeg      | identical |
 *   | pass-through ON  only                    | 144 417 | jpeg      | identical |
 *   | pass-through OFF + forced Flate          | 417 369 | flate     | identical |
 *
 * Two things that measurement settles:
 *
 *  1. **`-dPassThroughJPEGImages` is the flag that matters, and it is stated
 *     explicitly on purpose.** It defaults to true, which is why the issue's
 *     hand-run recipe did not corrupt anything — but the third row is what
 *     happens the moment it does not win: every photo is decoded and re-encoded
 *     as Flate, ~3x here and far worse on real photography (this is the
 *     reported 16 MB -> 254 MB). Relying on a default for that is not a plan.
 *  2. **The forced Flate filters stay anyway.** `AutoFilter*` defaults to true,
 *     and for an image Ghostscript genuinely must re-encode (a Flate-encoded
 *     source, which is what Chromium often produces) "auto" is free to choose
 *     DCT — a LOSSY re-encode of lossless print artwork, silently. Pinning the
 *     filter to Flate makes the only re-encode we can be handed a lossless one.
 *
 * `-dDownsample*=false` is the other half of the fidelity guarantee: without
 * it Ghostscript resamples to its default target and quietly destroys print
 * DPI. `-dSAFER` is default-on in gs >= 9.50 but passed explicitly — the input
 * is user content.
