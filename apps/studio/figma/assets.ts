/**
 * @file       figma/assets.ts — resolving image + vector fills (DDR-216 T8).
 * @scope      apps/studio/figma/assets.ts
 * @purpose    Turn `pendingImages` / `pendingExports` into real, local,
 *             content-addressed assets — batched, capped, and through the
 *             existing gates rather than a second download path.
 *
 * @invariant  BATCH, NEVER ONE CALL PER NODE. `IMAGE_COST = 200` ⇒ ~30 req/min
 *             on the images endpoint — the tight one. Figma's own translator
 *             emitted 22 exports for a trivial 990×648 frame; a real page would
 *             be hundreds. `to-artboard`'s vector-cluster collapse is the other
 *             half of this mitigation.
 *
 * @invariant  DOWNLOADS GO THROUGH `_fetch-asset.mjs`, WITH THE FIGMA LANE'S
 *             NARROWING. The URLs `/v1/images` returns are RESPONSE-CONTROLLED
 *             — Maude did not choose them. They get the full resolved-IP gate
 *             plus a host allowlist, a pinned port, and a tight byte cap. There
 *             is no second downloader here.
 *
 * @invariant  FAIL CLOSED. A vector goes through TWO processes in TWO runtimes
 *             (node for the download, bun for the DDR-167 SVG lane). DDR-177
 *             documents that runtime-spawned helpers have shipped broken inside
 *             the packaged `.app` more than once. If the sanitize step is
 *             unavailable, the staged bytes are DELETED and the node is reported
 *             `asset-skipped` — never "we already have the bytes", which is the
 *             natural and wrong recovery.
 *
 * @invariant  DOWNLOADS STAGE OUTSIDE THE DESIGN ROOT. The caller's per-run
 *             staging directory lives under the OS temp root, never under
 *             `<designRoot>/_history/` — "gitignored" is not "not replicated",
 *             and `~/git/.stignore` excludes neither.
 *
 * @limitation ASSETS PROMOTE PER-ASSET, NOT ONCE AT THE END. `deps.promote`
 *             writes into `<designRoot>/assets/` as each download completes, so
 *             a failure on frame 7 of 60 leaves earlier assets committed while
 *             the report says the import failed. D5 asked for a single
 *             directory rename; this is N renames. Stated as a KNOWN GAP rather
 *             than described as the guarantee it is not (post-implementation
 *             review F6) — content-addressing makes the residue harmless-but-
 *             untidy (orphan assets, no wrong content), which is why it is a
 *             limitation and not a blocker.
