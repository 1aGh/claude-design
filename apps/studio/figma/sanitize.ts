/**
 * @file       figma/sanitize.ts — the content rules (DDR-216 D6a + D6b).
 * @scope      apps/studio/figma/sanitize.ts
 * @purpose    The ONE place Figma-derived strings are made safe to emit, and
 *             the ONE place imported nodes are made VISIBLE. Both translators
 *             (`to-strokes.ts`, `to-artboard.ts`) go through here — D6's
 *             "single writers" requirement is what makes the standing grep test
 *             ("no translator interpolates a node's `name`/`characters` into
 *             output itself") a real control rather than a hope.
 *
 * @invariant  TWO INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS, because Round 2 of the DDR-216 review
 *             broke a single one twice:
 *
 *             D6a — CHARACTER CLASSES. An escaper covers characters that could
 *             terminate a literal. It does NOT cover characters with NO GLYPH.
 *             A payload encoded in the Unicode Tags block (U+E0000–E007F) — a
 *             full ASCII alphabet that renders as literally nothing — passes
 *             opacity 1, fontSize 16, high contrast, non-zero area, the escaper
 *             AND `sanitizeAnnotationSvg`, and is reconstructed as plain text by
 *             a model reading the file. Same for zero-width characters and the
 *             Trojan-Source bidi technique (CVE-2021-42574), where the rendered
 *             order a human reviews differs from the source order.
 *
 *             D6b — VISIBILITY, BY NORMALIZATION NOT DETECTION. The first draft
 *             tried to DETECT invisible nodes (opacity / fontSize / ΔE / clip)
 *             and the review broke it four ways — occlusion by an opaque later
 *             sibling, ancestor clipping, opacity compounded down the tree, and
 *             blend mode over a matching background — none of which a per-node
 *             property check can see. The translator AUTHORS these nodes, so it
 *             can GUARANTEE visibility instead of proving invisibility: clamp
 *             the size, force the contrast, clamp the geometry. Hidden text
 *             becomes VISIBLE text, which is strictly better than dropping it.
 *
 * @invariant  Neither mechanism makes an instruction stop reading like an
 *             instruction. That is DDR-216 residual 1, named there, not a bug
 *             here. What these rules buy is that nothing an agent later reads
 *             is invisible to the human who imported it.
 *
 * @invariant  DEPENDENCY-FREE — pure string/number work.
