// DDR-174 regression guard (T15).
//
// The whole security architecture of `/design:import --reconstruct` rests on
// ONE fact: every agent turn that ever reads the untrusted source image —
// `reconstruct-agent` (authoring) AND `reconstruct-critic` (the reality-check
// comparator) — has `tools: Read, Write, Glob, Grep` and NEVER `Bash`,
// `WebSearch`, or `WebFetch`. DDR-174's own Consequences section calls for
// exactly this test: "a targeted grep-based test mirroring
// plugin-cli-reachability.test.mjs's pattern should assert BOTH the authoring
// agent's AND the comparator agent's frontmatter never gain
// Bash/WebSearch/WebFetch, not just this DDR's prose." A future maintainer
// "helpfully" widening either agent's toolset (e.g. "just give it Bash so it
// can screenshot itself") would silently reopen DDR-174's entire closure —
// this fails loudly instead.
